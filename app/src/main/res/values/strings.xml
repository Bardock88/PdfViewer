    <string name="notice">
        Hello Users,\n\nAs you all know, this app has not gotten any updates recently. I am in my senior year of high school, bombarded with classes and college
        apps, which results in not that much free time for this app. Pdf Viewer Plus is open source, if any of you all would like to contribute, please
        do so. Because I have only been programming since the beginning of my high school career, my code might not be neat or follow up with any models or standards (that is why I need you guys!).
        Send me an email through the about page, or you can just go on to the Github repo (which the link is also in the about page).\n\nThanks for your patience!
